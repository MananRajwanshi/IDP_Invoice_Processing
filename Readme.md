This project is an intelligent document processing platform called InvoiceIQ, built using Streamlit to automate the extraction and analysis of invoice data. It leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, specifically PaddleOCR, to extract text from various document formats such as images, PDFs, and Word files. The extracted data undergoes processing and cleaning to identify invoice-specific fields, enabling structured information retrieval.

The platform supports multi-format uploads with efficient file handling and integrates natural language processing components for semantic text understanding. It incorporates a vector database for storing and querying document embeddings, which facilitates advanced search and information retrieval capabilities within the dashboard.

The user interface provides an interactive experience with real-time filtering, dynamic dashboards powered by Plotly visualizations, and sidebar controls for customization. Data processing features include automatic cleaning, validation, and date parsing, ensuring accurate analytics. The system updates results dynamically and offers responsive feedback, allowing users to explore and manage invoice documents effectively.

The OCR engine supports multiple languages for text extraction. This comprehensive system offers organizations an efficient and scalable tool for managing procurement document data, enabling better decision-making through detailed visualization and automated data extraction.
